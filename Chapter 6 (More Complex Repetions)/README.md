## Chapter 6 Exercises ðŸ“‘

A) Answer the following questions :

    a) The break statement is used to exit from:

       1. An if statement
       2. A for loop
       3. A program
       4. The main() function

       Answer : 2. A for loop

    b) A do-while loop is useful when we want that the statements within the loop must be executed:

       1. Only once
       2. At least once
       3. More than once
       4. None of the above

       Answer : 2. At least once

    c) In what sequence the initialization,testing and execution of body is one in a do-while loop ?

       1. Initialization, execution of body, testing
       2. Execution of body, initialization, testing
       3. Initialization, testing, execution of body
       4. None of the above

       Answer : 1. Initialization, execution of body, testing

    d) Which of the following is not an infinite loop ?

       1. int i = 1;
          while(1)
          {
              i++;
          }   

      2. for(;;);   

      3. int t = 0,f;
         while(t)
         {
              f = 1;
         }

      4. int y,x=0;
         do
         {
              y = x;
         } while(x == 0)   

        Answer : 3 

    e) Which of the following statements are true for the following program ?

        #include <stdio.h>
        int main()
        { 
          int x = 10, y = 100 % 90 ;
          for ( i = 1 ; i <= 10 ; i++ ) ;
          if ( x != y ) ;
          printf ( "x = %d y = %d\n", x, y ) ;
          return 0 ;
        }

        (1) The printf() function is called 10 times.
        (2) The program will produce the output x = 10 y = 10.
        (3) The ; after the if ( x != y ) would NOT produce an error.
        (4) The program will not produce any output.
        (5) The printf( ) function is called infinite times.

        Answer : 4. The program will not produce any output.

    f) Which of the following statement is true about a for loop used in a C program ?

        (1) for loop works faster than a while loop.
        (2) All things that can be done using a for loop can also be done using a while loop.
        (3) for (;;) implements an infinite loop.
        (4) for loop can be used if we want statements in a loop to get executed at least once.
        (5) for loop works faster than a do-while loop.  

        Answer : 2,3

B) Attempt the following questions :
