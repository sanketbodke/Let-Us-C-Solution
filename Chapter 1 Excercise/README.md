    }

    No Error : Multiple C statements can be written in a single line.

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()  
    {
    int a,b,c;

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int m1,m2,m3
    printf("Enter 3 subjects Marks")

    }

    Error: Semicolon should be present at the end of type declaration,printf() and scanf() statements. 

F) Attempt the following question.

a) Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees.

    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(){
    float f,c;
    printf("Enter temperature in fahrenheit: ");
    scanf("%f", &f);
    c = (f -32) * 5 / 9;
    printf("%f, temperature in celsius", c);
    return 0;
    }

b) The length and breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle, and the area and circumference of the circle.

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int le, brth, ar, pr, re;
    float cir, are;
    printf("\nEnter the length and breadth of a rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &le, &brth);
    ar = (le * brth);
    pr = 2 + (le * brth);
    printf("The area of rectangle = %d\n", ar);
    printf("The perimeter of rectangle = %d\n,", pr);

    printf("\nEnter the redius of circle: ");
    scanf("%d", &re);
    are = 3.14 * (re * re);
    cir = 3.14 * (re * 2);
    printf("The area of circle = %f\n", are);
    printf("The circumference of circle = %f\n", cir);
    return 0; 

    }

(c) Paper of size A0 has dimensions 1189 mm x 841 mm. Each subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to its shorter sides. Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841 mm x 594 mm. Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes A0, A1, A2, ... A8.

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int A0wd, A0ht;
    int A1wd, A1ht;
    int A2wd, A2ht;
    int A3wd, A3ht;
    int A4wd, A4ht;
    int A5wd, A5ht;
    int A6wd, A6ht;
    int A7wd, A7ht;
    int A8wd, A8ht;
 
    A0wd = 1189;
    A0ht = 841;
    printf("\nA0 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A0wd,A0ht);
 
    A1wd = A0wd / 2;
    A1ht = A0ht; 
    printf("\nA1 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A1wd,A1ht);
 
    A2wd = A1wd / 2;
    A2ht = A1ht;
    printf("\nA2 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A2wd, A2ht);
 
    A3wd = A2wd / 2;
    A3ht = A2ht;
    printf("\nA3 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A3wd, A3ht);
 
    A4wd = A3wd / 2;
    A4ht = A3ht;
    printf("\nA4 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A4wd,A4ht);
 
    A5wd = A4wd / 2;
    A5ht = A4ht;
    printf("\nA5 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A5wd, A5ht);
 
    A6wd = A5wd / 2;
    A6ht = A5ht;
    printf("\nA6 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A6wd, A6ht);
 
    A7wd = A6wd / 2;
    A7ht = A6ht;
    printf("\nA7 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A7wd, A7ht);
 
    A8wd = A7wd / 2;
    A8ht = A7ht;
    printf("\nA8 paper width: %dmm, height: %dmm", A8wd, A8ht);
 
    return 0;  
    }
