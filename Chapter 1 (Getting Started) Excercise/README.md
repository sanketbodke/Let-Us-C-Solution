    printf("final value is = %d\n", c);
    }

    No Error : Multiple C statements can be written in a single line.

    b)

    #include <stdio.h>

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()  
    {
    int a,b,c;
    scanf("%d %d %d, a,b,c");

    Error: We should use & before each variable used in scanf()

    d)

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int m1,m2,m3
    printf("Enter 3 subjects Marks")
    scanf("%d %d %d", &m1,&m2,&m3)

    }

    Error: Semicolon should be present at the end of type declaration,printf() and scanf() statements. 

F) Attempt the following question.

a) Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees.

    #include<stdio.h>
    int main(){
    float f,c;
    printf("Enter temperature in fahrenheit: ");
    scanf("%f", &f);
    c = (f -32) * 5 / 9;
    printf("%f, temperature in celsius", c);
    return 0;
    }

b) The length and breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle, and the area and circumference of the circle.

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main()
    {
    int le, brth, ar, pr, re;
    float cir, are;
    printf("\nEnter the length and breadth of a rectangle: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &le, &brth);
    ar = (le * brth);
    pr = 2 + (le * brth);
    printf("The area of rectangle = %d\n", ar);
    printf("The perimeter of rectangle = %d\n,", pr);

    printf("\nEnter the redius of circle: ");
    scanf("%d", &re);
    are = 3.14 * (re * re);
    cir = 3.14 * (re * 2);
    printf("The area of circle = %f\n", are);
    printf("The circumference of circle = %f\n", cir);
    return 0; 

    }

(c) Paper of size A0 has dimensions 1189 mm x 841 mm. Each subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to its shorter sides. Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841 mm x 594 mm. Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes A0, A1, A2, ... A8.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a0ht, a0wd;
    int a1ht, a1wd, a2ht, a2wd;
    int a3ht, a3wd, a4ht, a4wd;
    int a5ht, a5wd, a6ht, a6wd;
    int a7ht, a7wd, a8ht, a8wd;
    a0ht = 1189;
    a0wd = 841;
    printf("Size of A0 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a0ht, a0wd);

    a1ht = a0wd;
    a1wd = a0ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A1 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a1ht, a1wd);

    a2ht = a1wd;
    a2wd = a1ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A2 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a2ht, a2wd);

    a3ht = a2wd;
    a3wd = a2ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A3 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a3ht, a3wd);

    a4ht = a3wd;
    a4wd = a3ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A4 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a4ht, a4wd);

    a5ht = a4wd;
    a5wd = a4ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A5 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a5ht, a5wd);

    a6ht = a5wd;
    a6wd = a5ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A6 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a6ht, a6wd);

    a7ht = a6wd;
    a7wd = a6ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A7 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a7ht, a7wd);

    a8ht = a7wd;
    a8wd = a7ht / 2;
    printf("Size of A8 paper Height = %d Width = %d\n", a8ht, a8wd);
    
    return 0;
